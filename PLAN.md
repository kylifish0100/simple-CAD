# Plan

In this simple CAD software, I plan to implement the following features:
Drawing function: 
1. Basic 1d lines drawing such as straight lines, curve and arc; 
2. 2d shapes drawing such as circles, triangles, rectangles, polygons and pentagram;
3. Implement a color panel for user to choose color from, and fill any shape with their ideal color
4. Draw with measurement: input the essential statistic of any shape supported(circles, triangles, rectangles, polygons and pentagram) to create a shape with "create shape" button. For instance, input radius to draw a circle.
Shape procession:
5. Shape rotation and scaling function: user will be able to rotate selected shape and enlarge/shrink any shape by dragging the corner points
6. Copy & paste: directly copy and paste a selected shape drawed to a target position
7. Shape moving: drag a selected shape to another place. 
Labeling function:
8. Label part of the design with description text in a text box.
9. Click "get measurement" and then click on a shape to get its measurements.
Delete function:
10. If the painted shape or text is unwanted, user can delete the shape/text box with delete button.

Possible challenges: I feel I'm rather unfamiliar with Java swing tools and Graphics2D functions, so I may encounter many bugs and have no clues about how to implement a designed function. To tackle with it, I will look up for related online questions. And try my best to think the possible solution.
