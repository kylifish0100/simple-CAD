# Plan

Use this file to write a plan for your assignment.

You will need to submit a PLAN.md file before the end of Week 4. This should be around 400-words (or one page) long and
detail concretely what your application will do, what features you will include, and what some of the challenges might be
and how you plan to resolve them.

The word/page count is only a guide. If you include diagrams, you might find you need fewer words. Also, if you find it
necessary to use more pages to detail your project plan, that is ok too (but not required).
